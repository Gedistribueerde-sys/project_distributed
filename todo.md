# TODO

## LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Adding `recoverability` to the client-side: recovery mechanisms to handle corrupted messages.
- [ ] Implementing a `denial-of-service` (DoS) protection mechanism to prevent abuse of the bulletin board service.
- [ ] Application keeps working if 1 of the servers goes down -> implement server redundancy and failover mechanisms.

## NICE TO HAVE
- [ ] Add group chat functionality.
- [ ] Emoji support.
- [ ] File sharing capabilities.
