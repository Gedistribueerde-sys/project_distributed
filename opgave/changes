- when receiving key from another client but not giving yours to him, we need to be able to have one-way communication
- make sure the client app doesn't crash when server is offline for a while (buffering and queuing to send messages later?)
- storing and updating keys in keystore should be correcter / robuster
- bulletin board index should everywhere be int
- logout is not implemented
- storing messages -> history management + JSON serialization
- make sure before sending to check receiving messages

--- Advanced ---

- supporting recoverability of corrupted states
- the N (size of the board) should be able to grow: Increasing scalability -> partitioning the BB in chunks
- Tackling Denial-of-Service attacks
